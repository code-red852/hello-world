# hello-world

Everything has a beginning, and this is mine.

I am a mechanical engineering graduate currently working in business development.
With an aim to transition into a tech career, I've decided to pick up my programming skills from university once again and expand from there.
Looking forward to knowing/learning from/working with all of you.

Cheers,
